#Build & Run

# docker-compose build
# docker-compose up


# API will be available at: http://localhost:5000

# React build will be served from API’s / route.

# Uploaded images will be persisted via the volumes mount.

# I can also make it so during development, React runs in its own container with hot reload and API runs separately — so you don’t have to rebuild every time you change code.

# Do you want me to make that dev-ready docker-compose.override.yml too? That’s the usual production + development setup.
